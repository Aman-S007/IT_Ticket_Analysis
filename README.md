# IT_Ticket_Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of IT support ticket data using Excel-based techniques and structured reasoning. It combines objective metrics with subjective evaluations to uncover operational inefficiencies, agent performance gaps, and strategic investment opportunities.

## 📊 Data Sources
- **Tickets Sheet**: Contains 97,498 IT support tickets across categories like Hardware, Software, System, and Login Access.
- **IT Agents Sheet**: Details of 50 agents including demographics, ticket handling volume, and performance metrics.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Identify trends in ticket volume, resolution time, and satisfaction scores.
- Evaluate agent performance using KPIs such as average resolution time and satisfaction rate.
- Recommend improvements in staffing, training, and ticket management software.
- Perform correlation analysis between severity and resolution time.
- Segment performance by age group and request category.

## 🔍 Analytical Highlights
- **Average Daily Ticket Volume**: ~53 tickets/day over 1,827 days.
- **Resolution Time Analysis**: Average resolution time is 4.55 days.
- **Satisfaction Trends**: Improved steadily from 3.95 (2016) to 4.19 (2020).
- **Issue Type Distribution**: 75% IT Requests, 25% IT Errors.
- **Agent Performance**: Identified underperformers needing training (e.g., Agent ID 6, 22, 25).
- **Request Category Impact**:
  - Hardware: Longest resolution time (7.63 days)
  - Login Access: Fastest (0.31 days)
  - Software: Highest satisfaction (4.106)
- **Severity vs Priority Misalignment**: Revealed inefficiencies in ticket categorization.

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Excel formulas: `COUNTA`, `UNIQUE`, `AVERAGE`, `CORREL`, `VLOOKUP`, `MID`, `DATEDIF`
- Pivot tables and charts for time-series and categorical analysis
- Cost-benefit analysis for investment decisions

## 📈 Recommendations
- Hire additional agents to reduce resolution time.
- Implement targeted training programs for low-performing agents.
- Upgrade ticket management software to improve automation and prioritization accuracy.
- Enhance diagnostic tools for Hardware and System-related issues.

## 📌 Dashboard Metrics
To support decision-making, the final dashboard includes:
- Total Tickets & Tickets per Agent
- Daily Ticket Volume & Yearly Trends
- Resolution Time by Request Category
- Satisfaction Score Distribution
- Severity vs Priority Alignment
- Agent Age vs Performance Metrics
